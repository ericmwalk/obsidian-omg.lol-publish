Post status updates to [status.lol](https://status.lol) and optionally log them to your Obsidian notes.

## Features

- Post status updates to your status.lol address
- Choose whether to also share them on social.lol (this needs to be enabled on social.lol but can toggle off here per post)
- Save to a custom log note or to your Daily Note
- Works with both Daily Notes and Periodic Notes plugins
- If posting to status.lol fails it will still save to a note so you don't lose your status

## Setup

1. Clone or download this repo into your Obsidian `.obsidian/plugins/` folder.
2. Run `npm install` and `npm run build` to compile the plugin.
3. Enable the plugin inside Obsidian.
4. Configure the plugin settings (API key, address, and logging preferences).
